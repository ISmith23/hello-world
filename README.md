I am a student at UoPeople working on a BSc in Computer Science 
and here to learn the ropes as part of a course on Computer Graphics. 

That was a few terms ago, now I am in a Mobile Applications Course and having some fun with VR Course on a side. All making reverence to Git Hub. So I get the message - Learn how to use Git Hub!! :) 

Trying to get the hang of edits, pull requests and compare. Think I have it now.
